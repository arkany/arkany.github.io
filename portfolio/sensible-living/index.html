<p>My dad retired in 2007 and moved to Branson, MO. But my dad is a consumate creator and he quickly started up a small hardware business on <a href="https://www.tindie.com/stores/Michael_Phillips/">Tindie</a>. He built a series of smart home sensors and then also wrote PC software to manage them. When he showed me what he was working on, I thought it would be fun to chip in and add some UX help. I went out to visit him and we turned part of the trip into a 3 day UX crash course.</p>

<h2 id="process">Process</h2>

<p>The initial sensor management layout looked like this:</p>

<div class="row">
	<img src="/img/gallery/portfolio/sensible-initial.jpg" caption="The initial, spreadsheet layout for Sensible Living's interface." class="columns eight offset-two" />
</div>

<p>The initial onboarding experience looked like this:</p>

<div class="row">
	<img src="/img/gallery/portfolio/sensible-initial-onboard.jpg" caption="The initial, spreadsheet layout for Sensible Living's interface." class="columns six offset-three" />
</div>

<p>There are a few issues that I wanted to address:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Spreadsheets are great for hardcore users, but not very accessible to a regular user. I wanted to find a design that would be easy for anyone to use and see the status of their sensors.</li>
  <li>Find a more user-friendly experience for onboarding new sensors. Have the application generate a UID automatically, humanize the labels and CTAs. Finally, remove any settings that can be predefined. All that a normal user should need to fill out is the name, description and add a picture if they want.</li>
  <li>Users would need to plug their device into the receiver in order to onboard each sensor. I wanted to see if there was any way the receiver could auto-detect the sensor.</li>
  <li>Quietly start to think about how this could be used on a mobile device.</li>
</ol>

<p>After a few iterations, I came upon a card metaphor for each sensor. Card UI has been popular for a few years now and I see no signs of it stopping. As far as the onboarding process, I worked with my dad to cut all the fields that didn’t need tweaking for most users.</p>

<div class="row">
	<img src="/img/gallery/portfolio/sensible-wireframe.jpg" caption="The updated card UI layout." class="columns six offset-three" />
</div>
<div class="row">
	<img src="/img/gallery/portfolio/sensible-onboard-1.jpg" caption="first onboard screen - searching." class="columns four" />
	<img src="/img/gallery/portfolio/sensible-onboard-2.jpg" caption="second onboard screen - name and add picture." class="columns four" />
	<img src="/img/gallery/portfolio/sensible-onboard-3.jpg" caption="third onboard screen - add notifications." class="columns four" />
</div>

<p>The first visual pass brought to light a few new ideas:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The cards could color coordinate to their predefined type: moisture is green, temperature is blue, etc.</li>
  <li>In the event that a sensor held more than one sensor, could we test a design that had a stack of cards.</li>
  <li>Remove the border around the image.</li>
</ol>

<div class="row">
	<img src="/img/gallery/portfolio/sensible-cards-v1.jpg" caption="The updated card UI layout." class="columns ten offset-one" />
</div>

<p>While there’s much to change and enhance, I felt like this was a good case study and not too bad for a three day workshop. :)</p>

<p>…if you noticed the interim image on the main page is a mobile design. That’s just a little preview of what is currently in the works.</p>
