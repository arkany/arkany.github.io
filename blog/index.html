<p>Warning: <em>This article is geared toward independent comic creators, who also happen to be UX Designers and developers…so perhaps 4 other people.</em></p>

<p>From 2012-2014, my wife and I went through the process of creating our first <a href="http://highfructosezombies.com">graphic novel</a>. It was an amazing experience and working with your wife on a comic book is awesome. However, one thing I learned amongst how effing difficult it is to write 6 issues of narrative is the tedium of actually ‘making a comic’.</p>

<p>There’s a ton of non-creative work in comic administration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scan the pages</li>
  <li>Lettering issues (Copy the dialogue into Illustrator, speech bubble iterations)</li>
  <li>Import Illustrator into Photoshop (surprising number of alignment issues)</li>
  <li>Import Photoshop into InDesign</li>
  <li>Printing issues (export 14-17 different times to get it right, export 5 more for other digital vs print, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a fulltime job, so I would love to omit boring moments between the creative sparks of life.</p>

<h2 id="current-solutions">Current Solutions</h2>

<p>My astute friend Greg suggested I look at <a href="http://my.smithmicro.com/manga-studio-comic-illustration-software.html">Manga Studio</a>. The reviews are positive <a href="http://www.pauljholden.com/blog/2009/12/10/manga-studio-vs-photoshop-part-1/">[1]</a> and MS solves issues 3 &amp; 4, but there are a few issues:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Eliminates my current solutions for 2, which <a href="https://github.com/arkany/indie-comic-code">import all my dialogue</a></li>
  <li>Project collaboration. Both my wife and I work concurrently on the same issue. Without being able to access the same file at the same time, we’d be hindered. CAVEAT: I could import her individual pages into my project.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the meantime, I already built out a concept application for the problem, which I call…</p>

<p>##Project Johannes</p>

<p>The mission statement: To streamline comic production for independent comic creators.</p>

<p>Here’s my proposed feature set:</p>

<ul>
  <li>.fountain scripts generate all initial PSD / AI / InDesign dox</li>
  <li>All dialogue is automatically placed in AI file.</li>
  <li>Scanned images automatically go into PSD.</li>
  <li>PSD automatically goes into AI in hidden layer for lettering/layout stuffs</li>
  <li>PSD &amp; AI automatically go into InDesign.</li>
  <li>Autoupdate when you update script, PSD or AI files.</li>
  <li>1 click output for top 1-3 production houses(Comixology, Print Ninja, Ka-Blam?).</li>
  <li>BONUS: Completes part of the submission process for Comixology</li>
  <li>BONUS: Sharing/Layervault style review &amp; notes.</li>
  <li>BONUS: Dropbox sync?</li>
</ul>

<p>(Sidenote: Little did I realize that Pixelapse(alt to Layervault) would be bought by Dropbox, so that may be easier in ~1 year).</p>

<p>Here’s a quick visual breakdown of the user flow:</p>

<p>Here’s an initial layout that I was thinking about:</p>

<p><img src="/img/johannes_mockup.jpg" alt="Version 0.0.1 layout of Project Johannes" /></p>

<p>If anyone has any thoughts around the project, mainly if they would find it useful, let me know. If it’s only for me, I’ll make a far more hacky version of this product, but if people found it useful, it would be worth putting more effort.</p>

    <p><p><img src="/img/happy_holidays_2014.jpg" alt="Hello image" /></p>

<p>Well, quite a bit happened in the <em>16 months</em> since I updated last.</p>

<h2 id="new-gallery-items">New Gallery Items</h2>

<p>While I still can’t add all the work I did at Control Group, I did add some work on an unused <a href="/portfolio/upcoming">site design</a> and a new <a href="/portfolio/sarah-skull">flower skull logo</a> for Sarah Braly</p>

<h2 id="bing-wa">Bing, WA</h2>

<p>In October of this past year, <a href="http://sarahbraly.com">Sarah</a> and I moved to the Seattle area and I joined the UX team at <a href="http://bing.com">Bing</a>, where I have begun working on things I can never tell you about. It’s the irony of all designers that are doing great work - you’ll never see it. :)</p>

<h2 id="high-fructose-zombies-vol-1">High Fructose Zombies, Vol. 1</h2>

<p>We made a huge push for NYCC 2014 and completed High Fructose Zombies Vol. 1. It was a herculean feat for us and we were very proud of the result. A few thoughts on the process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When it came down to choosing a printer, we really wanted to go with a US printer, but the difference in price was over $4/copy. That’s no laughing matter. It’s the difference between making your upfront costs back back after selling 1/2 of your order or 3/4. That’s quite a few more comicons. That being said, it was a great learning process. If you are fastidious about your timelines, then I would wholly recommend <a href="http://printninja.com">Print Ninja</a>. They caught most of our PDF issues, with the exception of our outer cover spine.</li>
  <li>The tools available for independent comic book artists are meager at best. I created a few ExtendScripts to pull dialogue into Illustrator for lettering, which I put on <a href="https://github.com/arkany/indie-comic-code">Github</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sensible-living">Sensible Living</h2>

<p>My dad has been a better ITP student than I. During his retirement, he has managed to build Arduino-based smart home sensors and then wrote native Windows software to help run them. It’s called <a href="https://www.tindie.com/stores/Michael_Phillips/">Sensible Living</a>. We’ve been chatting and he’s looking to create a web interface. So, naturally, during my Xmas break, I wrote as much as I could. It’s a fresh redesign on the card view. The app was written in <a href="http://expressjs.com/">express.js</a>, jade, sass, and uses some free work from <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/">CoDrops</a>. I’m hoping to have an example page up soon on Heroku soon.</p>

<h2 id="section">2015</h2>

<p>Starting in 2015, I…well, I hadn’t intended on making a list, but since we’re here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Update this old thing 1/mo.</li>
  <li>Don’t let my coding skills go soft (a fulltime job in it’s own right).</li>
  <li>At least 1 drawing project.</li>
  <li>Travel to the British Isles.</li>
  <li>I’d love to create a CodeKit for Comics. But that feels a little too ambitious.</li>
</ul>

    <h2><a href="/2013/08/02/unit-testing-comics/">Gtd and comics unit testing</a> </h2>
    <h4>August 02, 2013</h4>
    <p><p>Back in my 20’s, I had the corpses of 1000 wasted days  in my wake. “Well, the script is just not coming to me today, I don’t know if it’s good anyway. I hate all the words!” etc. The older I got, the more I stood in my own way and that time adds up. Sometimes you just need to get s#!% done. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.fastcocreate.com/1683167/how-to-be-prolific-guidelines-for-getting-it-done-from-joss-whedon">Joss Whedon said it</a> better than me, “You know, it’s so easy to just get nothing done, but you’ve got to rock a little David Allen out to be able to get things done and break your list down into next actions.” </p>

<p><img src="/img/gtd.jpg" alt="Joss says Get Things Done" /></p>

<p>I read Getting Things Done and…honestly, well, I was terrible at it. To learn the same principles, I needed to learn code. </p>

<p>One of the many things I learned at <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/">ITP</a> and <a href="http://www.techstars.com/">TechStars</a> was the need for quick, rapid iteration.  Prove your hypothesis, get it on the screen, see what code works and use the console to figure out what broke.  So, when I came back to writing creatively, I applied the same principles.</p>

<ul>
  <li>write the outline</li>
  <li>read it</li>
  <li>rewrite it</li>
  <li>then write the first draft before I overthink it</li>
  <li>review it</li>
  <li>write it again</li>
  <li>send it to my friends for review</li>
  <li>and repeat</li>
</ul>

<p>Boom! Magic storymaking dust!  </p>

<p>The hope is that I’m catching my story flaws early, so that way I haven’t stacked more story on top of a flawed architecture, otherwise it’s more expensive to fix.  It’s much better than before.</p>

<p>There’s a huge gaping hole there that I run into, which is waiting for other people. And as we all have run into, the open source ones are sketchy and the proprietary ones are too expensive. It would be so much easier to just run my comic book script through the command line and see what errors came out.  </p>

<p><img src="/img/cb-unit-testing.jpg" alt="Act_2: B Story does not exist;" /></p>

<p>This is my dream. Alas, my dreams are deferred.  Please let me know if <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> or <a href="http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/">Jasmine</a> have a narrative nephew.</p>
